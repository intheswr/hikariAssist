2. Open an osz/osk file and you'll be asked to enter your osu! directory as it is in McOsu.

3. Everything should be set up. Refresh your songs list in McOsu and it should appear :)

## running from source (last resort)
using the latest version of both [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [go](https://golang.org/dl/):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nina-x/hikariAssist
cd hikariAssist
go run . {osz/osk path}

```
